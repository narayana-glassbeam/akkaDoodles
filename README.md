Composable Futures with Akka 2.0
================================
This is the companion microsite for the [book](http://slinnbooks.com/books/futures/index.jsp).
Although you can download compressed source code from this site, I suggest you clone the git repository instead 
so you can keep up to date more easily.

My Akka 2.0 notes are here, along with my other Typesafe notes:
