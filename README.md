Composable Futures with Akka 2.0
================================
This is the companion microsite for the [book](http://slinnbooks.com/books/futures/index.jsp).
Although you can download compressed source code from this site, I suggest you clone the git repository instead 
so you can keep up to date more easily.

My Akka 2.0 notes other Typesafe notes are here:
[http://scala.micronauticsresearch.com/akka-2-0](http://scala.micronauticsresearch.com/akka-2-0)

Here you will find source code, instructions for building with SBT, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. You can also log bugs.
Check out the tabs labeled **Wiki** and **Issues**.

I intend to use Google Hangout every week to chat about the book.
This is not meant as free consulting - instead, if there is something that is not clearly expressed, 
or a problem with a code example, I'd love to talk with you about it.
